## Good News

Good News is a Javascript application that filters articles provided by the Google News API to only show 'uplifting' results.



# MVP (Tuesday)

Our MVP is a webpage that displays a list of articles from Google News that filters out the word 'Brexit'. We aim to have this by end of day Tuesday.

Our goal is to continually improve the filtering logic every day, with a 'dream' goal of machine-learning implementation.
